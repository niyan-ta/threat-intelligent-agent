"""
agent/confidence.py — Confidence scoring for tool findings (BONUS).

Attaches a transparent, rule-based confidence level to each tool result so the
analyst knows how much to trust a verdict. Rule-based (not LLM-guessed) keeps it
explainable and deterministic — which is what a SOC analyst needs.

Usage (in graph.tool_node, right after a tool returns `result`):
    from agent import confidence
    result = confidence.score(intent, result)

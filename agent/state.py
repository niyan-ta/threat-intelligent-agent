"""
agent/state.py — The shared state that flows through the LangGraph.

In LangGraph, EVERY node receives this state, may read from it, and returns
a dict of updates that LangGraph merges back in. Think of it as a clipboard
that gets passed hand-to-hand down the assembly line — each station adds
something to it.

We use a TypedDict (LangGraph's native state type). It gives us key names
and type hints without the overhead of a full class.

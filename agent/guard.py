"""
agent/guard.py — Security guardrails for the Threat-Intel Agent.

Defense in depth — FOUR layers protect the agent:
  0. Azure OpenAI platform content-safety filter (upstream, automatic)
  1. Keyword pre-filter        — instant block on obvious injection phrases
  2. LLM injection/scope guard — structured-output classifier (GuardVerdict)
  3. Untrusted-data sanitizer  — wraps tool data so it's treated as DATA

Plus a friendly GREETING lane so social messages ("hi", "how are you?") get a
warm onboarding response instead of a cold security block (Conversational UX).

Two public entry points:
  • check_input(user_input) -> GuardVerdict
      Blocks DIRECT injection and OUT-OF-SCOPE requests; routes greetings to a
      warm handler. FAILS CLOSED: if Azure's content filter rejects the input,
      that rejection is treated as a BLOCK (not bypassed). Only non-safety
      transient errors (timeout/network) fall back to the keyword result.
  • wrap_untrusted_data(data_str) -> str
      Wraps tool/retrieved data with "treat as DATA, not instructions"
      delimiters — defends against INDIRECT injection hidden in retrieved intel.

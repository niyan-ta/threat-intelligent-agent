"""
tests/eval_harness.py — Evaluation harness (BONUS: "consistent behaviour across runs").

Runs a fixed set of representative queries through the agent and asserts the
router picks the EXPECTED intent each time. This:
  • proves consistent routing behaviour (the bonus criterion),
  • doubles as regression protection when tools/prompts change,
  • gives a clear pass/fail summary you can show in the demo.

Run from the project root:
    python -m tests.eval_harness

Note: security cases assert the guard BLOCKS (no routing occurs).
